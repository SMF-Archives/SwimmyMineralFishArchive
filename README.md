# SwimmyMineralFishArchive
This is an archive of (almost) all Swimmy Mineral Fish SB3 files, including more obscure versions, such as the July build. This archive is somewhat incomplete though, so feel free to open an issue or a pull request and add a missing version! Also, please don't try to post fake Swimmy Mineral Fish versions to the issues/PR, since they won't get added.
